# Expense Update Fix - Dashboard Real-time Updates

## Problem Description
The user reported two issues:
1. In the user dashboard, the expenses in the balance card were not being updated in real-time
2. In the user dashboard, in the budget progress section, the expenses were also not being updated in real-time

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that the dashboard was only loading dashboard stats once when the component mounted, but it wasn't recalculating the stats when transactions or budgets changed. The real-time listeners were only updating the individual `transactions` and `budgets` arrays, but the `dashboardStats` object (which contains the calculated expenses and budget progress) was not being updated.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Real-time Dashboard Stats Listener
Created a new method `onDashboardStatsChange` in `FirestoreService` that:
- Listens to both transactions and budgets collections in real-time
- Recalculates dashboard stats whenever either transactions or budgets change
- Ensures both data sources are loaded before calculating stats
- Includes proper error handling

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component
Modified the dashboard component to:
- Use the new real-time dashboard stats listener instead of separate transaction and budget listeners
- Update both `dashboardStats` and `transactions` when the real-time listener fires
- Keep a separate budget listener for the budget progress section display

### 3. Improved Data Flow
The new data flow ensures that:
- Dashboard stats are calculated immediately when both transactions and budgets are loaded
- Any changes to transactions or budgets trigger a recalculation of dashboard stats
- The UI updates in real-time without requiring manual refresh

## Files Modified

### `smart_budget_analyzer/src/services/firestoreService.ts`
- Added `onDashboardStatsChange` method for real-time dashboard stats updates
- Added `calculateDashboardStats` private helper method
- Improved error handling and data synchronization

### `smart_budget_analyzer/app/dashboard/index.tsx`
- Updated `useEffect` to use the new real-time dashboard stats listener
- Modified `loadDashboardData` to use stats from the real-time listener
- Removed separate transaction listener since it's now handled by the dashboard stats listener

## Technical Details

### Real-time Listener Implementation
```typescript
static onDashboardStatsChange(userId: string, callback: (stats: DashboardStats) => void) {
  // Listen to both transactions and budgets changes
  const transactionsQuery = query(collection(db, 'transactions'), ...);
  const budgetsQuery = query(collection(db, 'budgets'), ...);

  let transactions: Transaction[] = [];
  let budgets: Budget[] = [];
  let transactionsLoaded = false;
  let budgetsLoaded = false;

  const calculateAndCallback = () => {
    if (transactionsLoaded && budgetsLoaded) {
      const stats = FirestoreService.calculateDashboardStats(transactions, budgets);
      callback(stats);
    }
  };

  // Set up listeners for both collections
  // Call calculateAndCallback when either collection updates
}
```

### Dashboard Stats Calculation
The calculation logic ensures:
- Income transactions (positive amounts) are summed for total income
- Expense transactions (negative amounts) are summed for total expenses
- Budget progress is calculated by filtering transactions by category and summing expenses
- Recent transactions are sorted by date and limited to 5 items

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Add a new transaction (income or expense)
2. The balance card should update immediately showing the new total balance, income, and expenses
3. If you have budgets set up, the budget progress section should also update immediately
4. The changes should be reflected without requiring a manual refresh

## Benefits
- Real-time updates for all financial data in the dashboard
- Improved user experience with immediate feedback
- Consistent data across all dashboard sections
- Better performance by avoiding unnecessary API calls
